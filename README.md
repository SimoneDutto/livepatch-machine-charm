# Livepatch On-Premises server
# TODO: Update paths when the charmhub proj is created

The on-premises livepatch server enables the use of [Canonical Livepatch](https://ubuntu.com/security/livepatch)
in network-restricted environments.

Livepatch on-prem is deployed using a [juju bundle](https://charmhub.io/canonical-livepatch-onprem).

Documentation for this service is available on the [livepatch website](https:/ubuntu.com/security/livepatch/docs).
